Mediator pattern is very similar to Observer Event pattern. A mediator is best applied when two or more objects have an indirect working relationship, and business logic or workflow needs to dictate the interactions and coordination of these objects. e.g Widget steps. in Backbone, a parent view is a mediator which has access to all view components and can control/mediate them
