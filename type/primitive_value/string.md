# String

String is like array: arrays of characters, similiar method e.g. length, charAt() But also dislike array: array is mutable, string is __immutable__ (sting method can't edit in-place, but rather return a new string, so can't borrow array's mutation method .e.g reverse/push/splice/pop)

- length, indexOf
- concatenation
- string2array
