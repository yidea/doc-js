# React.js

### Intro 
React.js was initially coded for building Facebook's internal Ads system to solve the specific need of FB (code confidence, code readability, performance e.g. a multi input form(location, interest, language) - traditional mvc will have many models and make view hard to manage). Then it's used in more customer facing facebook.com open sourced in 2013.
 
- Benefit
  * Virtual DOM - replace browser dom and add a virtual layer, batch ui update smartly
  * Server rendering and shared module
  * Declare code -> predictable -> code confidence (easy to maintain/read)
  * Custom view system
  * Immutability
  * React native for mobile app: "Learn once, write anywhere"
